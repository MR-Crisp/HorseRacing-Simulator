## Overview

This is my horse racing simulator that I have created for my oop module project.

## Features

- Create a new horse
- See the stats of existin horses
- Set the conditions, lanes and which horses race (Track customization)
- Starting and reloading the race with updated horse stats


## Installation

1. Have a JDK installed firstly
2. Then download all the files.
3. The text file is not nessacary but can be useful to have.
4. Then compile the files `javac -d out src/**/*.java`
5. Then run the GUI class in the part 2 folder, or run the main class in the part 1 folder.

## Usage

Run the GUI class:

When you run the Gui class something like this should show:

If you click on the first button, it takes you to the new horse page, where you can create a new horse.

Here you can enter all the stats you want for the horse, and depending one what breed, saddle and shoe you choose, the confidence level, the speed and endurance of the horse change. The name and symbol dont effect the performance of the horse.

Now in the track settings part, this is where everything about the race is decided, where the horses go, which horses race and what the track conditions are. Depending on the track conditions, the colour of the track changes and on top of that the fall chances of the horse increases or decreases depending.

When the lanes are changed, the update lane button needs to be selected.

Finally for the start race screen:

The horse colour is represented. as well as its symbol and its shape depends on it s breed. The start race button starts the race, and these horses can be races multiple times and this will update thier confidence and race stats.
